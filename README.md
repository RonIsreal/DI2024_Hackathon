# DI2024_Hackathon

This is a simple "To-Do list" app. It has the basic functionalities, such as add and delete tasks.
There are still other functionalities that will be added and I will still revisit this code to improve its looks.
TO-DO:
  - Make it prettier by improving its CSS (prettier border, background and colors overall);
  - Add extra features, such as progress bar, strike through text once a task is marked as completed (checkbox mark);
  - Add a congratulatory message once all tasks have been completed;
  - Add a calendar so tasks can be added for future days and possibly track completed tasks from previous days;
  - Check the possibility of connecting it to a Google account to keep history/progress.

Funny thing to do a to-do list for a "to-do app". lol
